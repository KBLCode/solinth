## 🐛 Known Issues / Warnings

### ESLint Warnings (Non-blocking)

- `any` types in error handlers (acceptable for now)
- Unescaped quotes in JSX (cosmetic)
- Unused imports (will clean up)
- Console statements (for debugging)

### Database Connection

- Supabase pooler may timeout on first connection
- Retry if connection fails
- Use transaction pooler (port 6543)

## 📊 Test Results

### Environment

- Node.js: v24.5.0
- Next.js: 15.x
- TypeScript: Strict mode
- Database: Supabase PostgreSQL

### Status

- ✅ Basic tests: PASSED
- ✅ Build: SUCCESSFUL
- ✅ TypeScript: COMPILED
- ⏳ Manual testing: IN PROGRESS

## 🚀 Next Steps After Testing

1. Fix any critical bugs found
2. Clean up ESLint warnings
3. Add integration tests
4. Move to Task 3.1: Business Suite Dashboard
5. Implement tRPC for API layer
6. Add real-time subscriptions

## 📝 Notes

- Glassmorphic design is the signature visual identity
- Multi-tenancy is critical - ALWAYS filter by tenantId
- Better Auth handles all authentication
- Organizations = Tenants (1:1 mapping)
- Security is non-negotiable
