PlanPLAN: Solinth Suite v1.0
Implementation Roadmap
Executive Summary
Timeline: 6 months (26 weeks)Team Size: 100 developersApproach: Backend-first due to multi-tenant security requirementsGoal: Launch with as many of the 8 suites as possible in MVP
This plan provides a week-by-week breakdown with breadcrumb references to PRD requirements and SDD technical specifications. Each task references specific line numbers so developers know exactly what to build and how.
