PRD: Solinth Suite v1.0
Product Requirements Document
Executive Summary
Company: SolinthDomain: solinth.comProduct: Solinth Suite - All-in-one Business Management PlatformMission: "If it can't be measured, it can't be fixed"
Solinth is a comprehensive business management platform that consolidates all business tools into a single, unified suite. Unlike competitors who offer piecemeal solutions, Solinth provides eight integrated suites that track every business metric down to the micro number, enabling data-driven decisions through cross-metric correlations and AI-powered insights.
The platform offers unprecedented flexibility with three purchasing options: full bundle (best value), individual suites (Ã  la carte), or add-ons. This positions Solinth as "The Adobe Creative Cloud of business management" - professional, comprehensive, and scalable from solo founders to enterprises, but with the added benefit of flexible purchasing that Adobe doesn't offer.
Design Philosophy: Professional glassmorphic aesthetic with signature depth and luminosity, available in both light and dark modes using the Solinth brand palette.
Problem Statement
User Pain Points
P0: Tool Fragmentation Crisis

- Evidence: Businesses use 10-30+ different tools (Stripe, QuickBooks, Google Analytics, Mailchimp, etc.)
- Impact: Data silos prevent holistic business understanding, wasted time switching contexts
- Cost: $500-5,000/month across multiple subscriptions
  P0: Missing Correlations
- Evidence: Tools don't communicate, missing critical insights
- Impact: Can't see that support ticket volume correlates with churn, or that specific ad campaigns drive highest LTV customers
- Cost: Lost revenue from unoptimized operations
  P1: Surface-Level Metrics
- Evidence: Most tools show aggregate data only (monthly revenue, total users)
- Impact: Can't drill down to revenue per hour, per product, per employee
- Cost: Decisions based on incomplete information
  P1: Manual Report Generation
- Evidence: Hours spent weekly combining data from multiple sources
- Impact: Delayed insights, human error in calculations
- Cost: 10-20 hours/week of employee time
  P2: Expensive Enterprise Solutions
- Evidence: Comprehensive solutions cost $10,000+/month
- Impact: SMBs and startups can't afford proper analytics
- Cost: Competitive disadvantage vs well-funded competitors
