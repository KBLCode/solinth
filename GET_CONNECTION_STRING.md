# Get Supabase Connection String

## Quick Fix Needed

The database connection is almost working, but we need the exact connection string format from your Supabase dashboard.

## Steps:

1. **Go to your Supabase dashboard:** https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. **Navigate to:** Settings > Database
3. **Find the "Connection string" section**
4. **Copy the "Connection pooling" URL** - it should look like:
   ```
   postgresql://postgres.cbmxylsawzthddeweugd:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres
   ```
5. **Also copy the "Direct connection" URL** - it should look like:
   ```
   postgresql://postgres.cbmxylsawzthddeweugd:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres
   ```

## What I Need:

Please share both connection strings (with `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` placeholder) so I can update the `.env` file with the correct format.

## Current Status:

✅ Supabase project created  
✅ API keys configured  
✅ Prisma schema ready  
❌ Connection string format (almost there!)

Once we get the connection string right, we can:

1. Push the database schema (create all tables)
2. Apply Row-Level Security policies
3. Seed the database with test data
4. Verify multi-tenant isolation

## Alternative:

If you can't access the dashboard right now, you can also:

1. Go to the SQL Editor in Supabase
2. Run: `SELECT version();`
3. If that works, we know the connection is good and it's just a format issue
